# Chromium

* page action doesn't work from icon on file:// (though from keybind it works fine
)
  'Error during tabs.executeScript: Cannot access contents of url "file:///hom
e/nick/marlbo2.htm". Extension manifest must request permission to access this host.
'
  which is unfair, as it does (with <all_urls>). likely therefore a bug in chromium.
