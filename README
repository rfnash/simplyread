Readable
========

Readable is a simple program to remove unwanted distractions from
webpages, in order to better enjoy reading on the web. It removes
everything but the article from a webpage, displaying it
simply and attractively.

Running the program multiple times switches between showing the
original page and the 'readable' version.

This project is technically inspired by Arc90's Readability,
but aims to be much simpler, faster, and more usable. More
generally, it is inspired by Sean Birketts' *The Gutenberg
Elegies* and Nicholas Carr's *The Shallows*.

"The ever-present awareness of possibility to either make or
refuse choice, was to preempt my creating any meditative space
for myself"
 - *Sean Birketts, The Gutenberg Elegies*
