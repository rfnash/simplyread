Readable is written in ECMAScript, and how to launch it varies a
little depending on browser.

# Uzbl

To use this from uzbl, add the following line to the config file
(replacing 's' with the key to bind to):

@cbind s = script file:///path/to/readable.js

You'll also have to add the statement 'readable();' to the bottom of
readable.js.


# Surf

To use it from surf, and trigger it from a key combination, add the
following to script.js (replacing the keyIdentifier if you want to
bind to a key other than Ctrl-S):

(function() {
    document.addEventListener('keydown', keybind, false);
})();

function keybind(e) {
    if (e.keyIdentifier == "U+0053" && e.ctrlKey) // ^s
		readable();
}
/* copy readable.js here */


# Other browsers; 'bookmarklet'

To use this as a 'bookmarklet', create a new bookmark with an address of:

javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='file:///path/to/readable.js';readable()})();

Note that due to browsers being afraid of mixing local and remote files
this may not work for http:// addresses. If this is the case, you can
either run the script from a remote location (eg your webserver), or
integrate it into a browser-specific extension.
