Readable is written in ECMAScript, and how to launch it varies a
little depending on browser.

# Firefox

Readable is now packaged as an addon for firefox (and other browsers
of its kin.) You can either get it from the readable web page, or
build it by running:

	make xpi


# Chromium

Readable also exists as an extension for chromium (and derived browsers.)
It isn't currently available on the "extensions gallery," but if someone
wants to post it there, please go ahead. For now you can get it from the
readable web page, or by running:

	make crx

# Surf

To use readable from surf, and trigger it from ctrl-alt-r, add the
following to script.js

(function() {
	document.addEventListener('keydown', keybind, false);
})();

function keybind(e) {
	if (e.keyIdentifier == "U+0052" && e.ctrlKey && e.altKey) // ctrl-alt-r
		readable();
}
/* copy readable.js here */


# Uzbl

To use this from uzbl, add the following line to the config file:

@cbind r = script file:///path/to/readable.js

You'll also have to add the statement 'readable();' to the bottom of
readable.js.


# Other browsers; 'bookmarklet'

To use this as a 'bookmarklet', create a new bookmark with an address of:

javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='file:///path/to/readable.js';})();javascript:(function(){readable();})();

Note that due to browsers being afraid of mixing local and remote files
this may not work for http:// addresses. If this is the case, you can
either run the script from a remote location (eg your webserver), or
integrate it into a browser-specific extension.
