gecko:
	test with firefox 4.0, and update version info
		http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/11/11/making-add-on-compatible-firefox-4/
		will have to attach the button to the 'addon bar', rather than the status bar
		the addon bar is a standard 'toolbar', so things have to be rewritten accordingly

		https://developer.mozilla.org/en/XUL/Toolbars/Creating_toolbar_buttons
		this means i'll have to set the icon image using css - note that this can be a svg (see http://blog.mozilla.com/addons/2010/12/02/toolbar-buttons-in-firefox-4/ )
	include a 64x64 icon for the addon manager
		hopefully done by just putting in root - needs testing as iconURL vs icon64URL documentation conflicts
		do try a straight svg here too (just called icon.svg) (prob won't work)

	get working with firefox mobile https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Extensions
	finish update support. this means use tool http://www.softlights.net/projects/mxtools/uhura.html to sign mozilla thing
		once it's working look into using rapper and bourne shell script to sign
		this is difficult as mozilla wants the signature of a very particular serialisation of the update rdf
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extension_Versioning,_Update_and_Compatibility#Update_RDF_Format
		openssl dgst -sha512 -binary -sign private.pem web/gecko-updates.rdf i'm pretty sure generates the correct signature. however it then has to be encoded, using asn1/der & base64. also, according to the docs only the hash is signed/hashed, whereas it looks like the whole (particularly serialised) rdf is used by uhura

build:
	set website from makefile variable / sed everywhere
	add clauses to makefile so make can work without a private key (for easy 3rd party modifications etc)

web:
	change 'download simplyread' button to 'simplyread 0.4 source'

test:
	current tests
		test the keyboard shortcut, by sending an event;
			e=document.createEvent(...
			e.initEvent(...
			e.keyCode = ...
			document.body.dispatchEvent(e)
		window.close directly after logging to the console
	make tests for chromium and firefox engines
