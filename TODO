gecko:
	get working with firefox mobile https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Extensions
	finish update support. this means use tool http://www.softlights.net/projects/mxtools/uhura.html to sign mozilla thing
		once it's working look into using rapper and bourne shell script to sign
		this is difficult as mozilla wants the signature of a very particular serialisation of the update rdf
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extension_Versioning,_Update_and_Compatibility#Update_RDF_Format
		openssl dgst -sha512 -binary -sign private.pem web/gecko-updates.rdf i'm pretty sure generates the correct signature. however it then has to be encoded, using asn1/der & base64. also, according to the docs only the hash is signed/hashed, whereas it looks like the whole (particularly serialised) rdf is used by uhura
