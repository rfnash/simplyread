finish update support. this means use tool http://www.softlights.net/projects/mxtools/uhura.html to sign mozilla thing, and test both mozilla and chrome things actually work

core:
	it would be nice to do hyphenation. http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/ is nice, but heavyish (around 2000 LOC). most of that is just unneeded config options etc, though, the core looks reasonable; see hyphenate and hyphenateWord functions. note that it's lgpl.

chromium:
	page action doesn't work from icon on file:// (though from keybind it works fine)
	fix makecrx.sh to work with 9base utils
	look further into permissions; see if we can scale back
		so we don't get warnings; after all, no network or disk
		activity happens at all. if not, ask on a 'google group' or
		similar (may be able to post over nntp..)

gecko:
	test with firefox 4.0, and update version info

build:
	set website from makefile variable / sed everywhere
	build to current directory, not web

web:
	change 'download simplyread' button to 'simplyread 0.4 source'

test:
	current tests
		test the keyboard shortcut, by sending an event;
			e=document.createEvent(...
			e.initEvent(...
			e.keyCode = ...
			document.body.dispatchEvent(e)
		window.close directly after logging to the console
	make tests for chromium and firefox engines
