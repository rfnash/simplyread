chromium:
	generate appid for use in update xml
		see GenerateId in extension.cc of chrome for how it works
		currently should be dbggpgfcgemloeeldimghohejgnkahdi

gecko:
	use rapper and bourne shell script to sign
		this is difficult as mozilla wants the signature of a very particular serialisation of the update rdf
		https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extension_Versioning,_Update_and_Compatibility#Update_RDF_Format
		openssl dgst -sha512 -binary -sign private.pem web/gecko-updates.rdf i'm pretty sure generates the correct signature. however it then has to be encoded, using asn1/der & base64. also, according to the docs only the hash is signed/hashed, whereas it looks like the whole (particularly serialised) rdf is used by uhura

test:
	current tests
		test the keyboard shortcut, by sending an event;
			e=document.createEvent(...
			e.initEvent(...
			e.keyCode = ...
			document.body.dispatchEvent(e)
		window.close directly after logging to the console
	make tests for chromium and firefox engines

# wishlist #

gecko:
	it would be nice to use the svg icon directly (smaller, faster, neater)
		firefox doesn't render the font correctly (can't find bug; test more then report it)
		doesn't automatically set the size (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=583231#c31 - may be workaroundable by setting class of the image to toolbarbutton-1)
		doesn't work for main addon icon (only toolbar) (can't find bug; test more then report it)
	get working with firefox mobile https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Extensions

chromium:
	it would be nice to use the svg icon directly (smaller, faster, neater)
		currently not supported (http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=29683)
	would be nice to have permission warning reflect the fact that no disk or network activity is done; that this is self-contained and lovely. unfortunately it isn't fine-grained enough, and we need all "tabs" permission to inject the script into any page
